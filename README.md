## üåü Features

### Spherical Social Media Carousel
- **11 Social Media Platforms**: LinkedIn, GitHub, Discord, Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest, Quora, and Reddit
- **3D Spherical Distribution**: Icons arranged in a perfect sphere using mathematical calculations
- **Interactive Rotation**: Mouse-controlled rotation with realistic physics
- **Inertia System**: Smooth momentum-based movement that continues after mouse release
- **Auto-rotation**: Gentle continuous rotation when idle
- **Hover Effects**: Icons transition from grayscale to full color with brand-specific backgrounds
- **Smart Tooltips**: Platform names appear on hover
- **Auto-close Timer**: Sphere automatically closes after 30 seconds of inactivity

### Cube Menu
- **6 Customizable Faces**: Each face can display different images and link to different URLs
- **Hover Expansion**: Cube grows from 30px to 100px on hover
- **Auto-rotation**: Continuous rotation when not interacted with
- **Mouse-controlled Rotation**: Direct manipulation with smooth physics
- **Inertia Effects**: Realistic momentum when mouse is released

## üöÄ Demo

```html
<!-- Simply open menu.html in a modern web browser -->
```

*Note: Requires browsers with CSS 3D transforms support*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonelpedroza/3d-interactive-menu.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash

## üé® Customization

### Changing Social Media Links

Find the social media links in the HTML and update the `href` attributes:

```html
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" class="social-icon linkedin" data-name="LinkedIn">
    <!-- SVG icon -->
</a>
```

### Customizing Cube Menu

1. **Change Images**: Replace the images in the `Picture/` folder
2. **Update Links**: Modify the `href` attributes in the cube faces:

```html
<div class="cube-face face-front" style="background-image: url('Picture/Picture1.png');">
    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Picture 1"></a>
</div>
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed

- **Sphere Auto-rotation**: Modify the velocity values in `startSlowRotation()`
- **Cube Auto-rotation**: Change the animation duration in CSS:
```css
animation: rotateCube 10s infinite linear; /* Change 10s to desired duration */
```

### Changing Colors

- **Sphere Trigger Button**: Update the gradient in `.sphere-trigger`
- **Social Media Colors**: Modify the hover colors for each platform in CSS

## üîß Technical Details

### Sphere Mathematics

The sphere uses spherical coordinates to evenly distribute icons:

```javascript
const phi = Math.acos(-1 + (2 * index) / numIcons);
const theta = Math.sqrt(numIcons * Math.PI) * phi;
```

### Physics Implementation

- **Velocity Calculation**: Based on mouse movement delta
- **Friction**: 0.98 multiplier for smooth deceleration
- **Inertia Duration**: ~5+ seconds of continued movement

### Performance Optimizations

- Uses `transform3d` for hardware acceleration
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Event delegation for efficient event handling

## üìù Code Structure

The code is organized into three main sections:

1. **HTML Structure**: Semantic markup for both menu systems
2. **CSS Styling**: Comprehensive styles with 3D transforms
3. **JavaScript Logic**: Separated concerns for sphere and cube functionality
